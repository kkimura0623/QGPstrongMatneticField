INLINE REPORT: (PHOTON_PROP_TEST) [1] photon_prop_test.F90(1,9)


    Report from: Loop nest, Vector & Auto-parallelization optimizations [loop, vec, par]


LOOP BEGIN at photon_prop_test.F90(48,3)
   remark #15344: loop was not vectorized: vector dependence prevents vectorization. First dependence is shown below. Use level 5 report for details
   remark #15346: vector dependence: assumed OUTPUT dependence between at (49:5) and at (49:5)
   remark #25436: completely unrolled by 4  
LOOP END


Non-optimizable loops:


LOOP BEGIN at photon_prop_test.F90(53,3)
   remark #15543: loop was not vectorized: loop with function call not considered an optimization candidate.

    Notes
    
        *Non-overlapping variables and spills may share stack space,
         so the total stack size might be less than this.
